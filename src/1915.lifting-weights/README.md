# 1915 - [Lifting Weights](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/1915/)

## Description
Ollie is new to the gym and is figuring out the maximum weights she can lift. The maximum capacity of the barbell is given as `maxCapacity`. There are `n` barbell plates in the gym.The weight of the `i-th` barbell piece is `weights [i]`. Now Ollie has to select as many plates as she can but the total weight of the selected plates should not exceed maxCapacity. What is the `maximum` weight of plates Ollie can add to the barbell?

For example, given barbell plates of `weights of 1, 3 and 5` lbs and a barbell of `maximum capacity 7` lbs - the right plates to insert would be `1` and `5` lbs (1 + 5 = 6), thus making the right answer `6`.

```
1 ≤ n ≤ 42

1 ≤ maxCapacity ≤ 10**6

1 ≤ weights[i] ≤ 10**6
```
